        <h1>My Role Models</h1>
        <p>Hi, I wanted to make my comments for my role models. Therefore, this page contain my opinions.</p>
        <h1>Nikola tesla</h1>
        <img class="tesla-img" src="images/tesla.png" alt="Tesla Picture">
        <p>Nikola Tesla is one of the my favourite scientist because he has brain which beyond the times. He has lots of inventions. In my opinion Nikola Tesla's best invention was alternative current. If people didn't use alternative current, a lot of wires would be used everywhere. In additionaly, alternative current is cheaper than direct current. </p>

    <div class="hezârfen-row">
        <h1>Hezârfen Ahmed Çelebi</h1>
        <img class="hezârfen-img" src="images/galata.png" alt="Hezârfen Ahmed Çelebi Picture">
        <p>First of all, when I heard his name, I imagine Galata Tower due to the succesfull flight of him. Also, he faced a lot of challenging situation but he did not think about give up his' flight adventure. If I feel stuck for developing, I am thinking Hezârfen Ahmed Çelebi's flight adventure. From my point of view, it is high motivation source for me.</p>
